Music is a huge part of my life. I have collected music for 30 years (underground & independent). I DJ'd extensively around the city in the 90s. I have a small amateur music studio in my flat and have been making electronic music for over 10 years now.  I enjoy many other cultural pursuits with Edinburgh offering much in this regard. I have a mostly vegetarian diet and take much interest in the environment. I have a fairly well honed sense of humour and really enjoy having a laugh with people.

PATSY'S PROFILE:
I have enjoyed life as a professional musician, singing and playing my clarsach (Scottish harp) taking Scottish and Gaelic music around the world.  I also love homecrafts and spent many a happy hour working on The Great Tapestry of Scotland (panel 135 - The First Edinburgh Festival 1947) organised by Ann - she kept me in stitches!   Since becoming a mum I have been more home based imparting my love of music to others, especially children, and organising music events in castles.


ANN'S PROFILE:
Hi, I work as a teacher in an Edinburgh secondary school supporting pupils with additional needs. I love my job but try to also fit into my life my other passions. Music: I play the cello in an orchestra and play the piano badly to myself.
Art: I draw, paint, knit and make quilts
Outdoors: I run a programme that organises camping and hiking expeditions all over Scotland for teenagers and have a passion for the hills. I used to work as a climbing and outdoor instructor.
I try to bring up two wonderful teenage boys ....and my husband.

Speaking of which...

Hi, I work as a joiner and audio visual specialist as my day job and at nights play guitar or bass in different bands.

I was born in Asia and came to Edinburgh over 10 years ago as a student. I was lucky enough to be able to stay in this country after my study and have been living in this beautiful city ever since. Should I call myself half Scottish? lol...

I would like to think that I am an useful person to this society although I haven't accomplished much in life so far. I love life and I am passionate about what I do. My friends think I am a perfectionist. On the other hand, I don't take life too seriously. I like self mockery, which I think is a different and fun way of looking at life in general. I value intelligence and kindness. In my opinion, being kind is a core value of a personal quality.

I am a very sociable person and love travelling. I will take every opportunity to go on a trip if I can. Being a host provides me with plenty of opportunities to meet and interact with people from different culture. I am also very much into sports. I fill most of my spare time with playing badminton and tennis.  oh yes I run a lot. 

Having worked in hospitality before, I feel like this is the extension of my experiences. I hope you will like my home and I will try my best to make your airbnb experience worthwhile.

I trade at vintage markets all over the UK and spend a lot of my weekends travelling far and wide selling my work, so you might find you have the place to yourself if you book over a weekend.

 As a creative person, how my home looks and feels is very important to me, I have redecorated every room myself, making it really comfortable, and hung lots of cool art of course! The previous tenant was also an artist and painted large murals all over the flat which I've made sure to keep and integrate with my own style. 

I use Air BnB all the time when I'm travelling with my business so I know what it takes to be a really good host. It's important to me that my guests feel like they can treat my place as if it's their own when they're staying with me. I've had permanent flat mates before so I'm used to sharing my space and love to spend my evenings chatting with house guests, but am also very comfortable leaving guests to themselves (like I sometimes prefer when traveling for work) because I know travelling can be quite exhausting and often we just need a quiet night in bed! 

I like to relax by painting/crafting, watching films or reading. I have a passion for sci-fi and fantasy fiction and tend to just devour books of that genre (feel free to borrow anything from my bookshelf when you stay with me). Also, if you like to spend the odd evening playing board games I have a few, and love to share a game night with guests.

I love Edinburgh and know loads of great places to go and things to do, if you stay with me I'll make sure you have the best local knowledge of the city, and can make the very most of your time here!

Also, I have a Spanish lesson every week so I can speak a little bit...por desgracia no estoy fluido pero, me gusta practicar!

Happy Booking,

I love my job - the best part is  meeting the wonderful, inspiring people that are doing all kinds of awesome environmental projects and having the chance to experience different cultures in a connected way that would be really difficult as a tourist.  Thats also why i love Airbnb - i often stay in hotels for shoots but much prefer the airbnb experience - i like meeting hosts, getting off the tourist trail and benefiting from a little local knowledge in order to get a better sense of a place. 

Some of my most memorable experiences so far have been cattle ranching in Mato Grosso, Brazil - Fungi Hunting in the Arctic, scuba diving in a futuristic fish farm in Baja California  and flying a cesna through a lightning storm over the Congo.

After living in London for years I  moved back to Edinburgh to do a MFA in Art , Space and Nature  at the Edinburgh College of Art  - so now spend most of my time making ecologically engaged artwork . You can find me on all the regular social media platforms and view all of my earthrise films online if you are into that kind of stuff.. 

Cheers!

The eyes of the world were firmly fixed upon “The Royal mile” recently when Queen Elizabeth died, and her coffin was marched up the Royal mile, to St Giles cathedral. 

My home truly is a part of Scottish history and I share it with you happily. 

I am one of the last generation of natives born and raised in the shadow of Edinburgh castle on the historic dastardly Royal Mile, who still has a residence here, and who call it HOME. 

As a teenager, I was briefly in service to The Queen working in the kitchens of Holyrood Palace before I followed my star to America, New York City to be exact checking in at the notorious Chelsea hotel, I fell in line with the downtown glitterati set and immersed myself in the nightlife. 

Encouraged to write by The Empress of Punk, Patti Smith after a chance meeting at cafe Figaro in the west village, Writing became my therapy.  

Eleven brutally beautiful winters later I washed up and thawed out on Miami’s south beach where I caught the eyes and ears of Music Mogul Desmond child who signed me to a publishing deal. I am fortunate to have enjoyed a career in the cutthroat music buisness for over twenty years, equipped with wit and wisdom undoubtedly due to my childhood as a wolf pup growing up on the unforgiving streets of the Immortal city, Edinburgh.

Passionate about making Art and mentoring anyone who wishes to lead an Artists life. I have risen from the gutter to the stars and am passionate about imparting what I have learned to anyone with an open heart. 

Rugby, Photography & Equestrian pursuits occupy my free time and use my Horse to heal my mind spirit and body after the death of my beloved father Rab. Salt of the earth. 

Edinburgh is a beguiling city of contrasts, revealing her secrets one whisper at a time. She is as interesting as she is beautiful. 

I am honored to share my residence with you, and hope it brings strength and peace to you on your journey through the greatest adventure of all... Life. 

Anything you need? just ask. 

Few people love Edinburgh more than I.

JOHN'S PROFILE: 
I work as a joiner and audio visual installer as my day job and at nights play guitar or bass in different bands, playing Scottish Country Dance music and also blues and R&B. I am a keen nano beer brewer and hobby beekeeper with 12-15 colonies at a small apiary near Borthwick Castle, about 12 miles south of Edinburgh.  I love the outdoors enjoying hillwalking, endurance running, road cycling and mountain biking. I have recently got into fixed wheel cycling.  I love living in Edinburgh - it's a fantastic city, with so much going on, and it's also really easy to get out and into the beautiful surrounding countryside.

PATSY'S PROFILE: 
I have enjoyed life as a professional musician, singing and playing my clarsach (Scottish harp) taking Scottish and Gaelic music around the world. I also love homecrafts and spent many a happy hour working on The Great Tapestry of Scotland (panel 135 - The First Edinburgh Festival 1947) organised by Ann - she kept me in stitches! Since becoming a mum I have been more home based imparting my love of music to others, especially children, and organising music events in castles.

ANN'S PROFILE: 
Hi, I work as a teacher in an Edinburgh secondary school supporting pupils with additional needs. I love my job but try to also fit into my life my other passions. Music: I play the cello in an orchestra and play the piano badly to myself. 
Art: I draw, paint, knit and make quilts 
Outdoors: I run a programme that organises camping and hiking expeditions all over Scotland for teenagers and have a passion for the hills. I used to work as a climbing and outdoor instructor. We have two grown up boys.",https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/184042735

Im from Scotland and currently living and working in Dubai. Have worked and lived abroad in many countries and passionate about traveling so I have a pretty good idea of what travellers are looking for when holidaying abroad. 
I would consider the following to be my main priorities when traveling; 
Location; easy access to all points of interest and to transport. I also prefer it to be situated in a peaceful area as I like my sleep.
Comfort; good beds, a decent shower and a pleasant place to hang out in when putting my feet up after a day sightseeing.
Cleanliness: I love a place that is clean and well maintained. Hygiene is very important to me when traveling (unless I am up jungle of course lol).
Facilities; wifi is essential and decent TV is appreciated too.
I believe my apartment meets all the above criteria that I myself expect when traveling. I’m sure you won’t be disappointed should you choose to be my guest.

Edinburgh is an amazing city, but be sure to enjoy the wider benefits it has to offer like the amazing walking, climbing, golf, and indulging in the individual shops and cafes in the West End, Stockbridge and Morningside. 

Some of my recommendations:

- The apartment is close to the Water of Leith walkway. You can take an alternative tour through the city to Leith or to Balerno. It’s about a 20km from end to end, very relaxing and enjoyable walk.

- On Sundays, the Stockbridge market is amazing for foodies and just for browsing. 

- The Fox & Co eatery downstairs offers incredibly good food during the day at amazing prices. At night, restaurants like Otro just around the corner or our favourite, Locando De Gusti, an amazing Italian on Dalry Road nr Haymarket station is phenomenal (book well in advance). Others like Whiski Rooms is an incredibly interesting concept of food with matching whisky selections.

I am happy sharing my home with visitors and this is a great location from which to access other parts of Scotland.

Walkers and cyclists will find that we are near the John Muir Way and convenient for the Fife Pilgrim Way and Fife Coastal Path. We are less than 10 minutes' walk from the stop  for the 747 airport bus (20 minutes by bus to the airport ) and only 2 minutes' walk from the stop for the Lothian No.43 bus , which makes the pleasant half-hour journey into the centre of Edinburgh several times each hour. We are close to the beautiful bridges across the River Forth.
South Queensferry has a picturesque , historic old town, complete with harbour, and a variety of friendly cafés and restaurants to enjoy.

Then there are the shops: both big name ones up at St James Quarter, and quirky independent ones on Leith Walk. 

Although I have lived in Edinburgh for many years, I was raised internationally so I love meeting people from other places.  I speak a bit of French, although it needs practice, and a little Gaelic, which also needs practice.

I grew up in Edinburgh but after moving away for a few years, it made me realise what an amazing place Edinburgh really is. I was delighted to buy my first flat over two years ago in South Queensferry an area I have always loved.  I joined the local rugby team and made good friends. I have very much enjoyed living here.

I met my lovely girlfriend Erin a few years ago and we now stay together in Edinburgh. So I'm not far away. We can see ourselves back in South Queensferry in the future and felt letting my flat out was the best option particularly given its great location and lovely views.

I am a big petrolhead, enjoy cycling, good food and a glass of vino occasionally.",https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/65900320

Ever since I was a young boy, my family have been regular visitors to Cornwall and Devon. I now own a small travel company called Sand and Stone Escapes (formerly Beachspoke) that represents a collection of uniquely curated holiday homes inspired by our love of travel and design. Each one reflects the amazing locations in which they reside and have been built and designed either by me, my mother or a like-minded owner we represent. 

A short break is rare for most these days, but when given the chance, my favourite thing to do is to hop in the car to Cornwall with my wife and our friendly Greek mongrel, Tiko, for a few days of walks by the sea, amazing food in the local restaurants and cosy nights in with a movie and a glass of wine. 

We believe a holiday home should have all the perks of a small boutique hotel and have ensured that all the properties are equipped with small luxuries from fluffy bathrobes to a bottle of sparkling wine or Champagne in the fridge for your arrival. We are always on hand to assist should you need but would never disturb you otherwise.

We hope you enjoy these hideaways and the places where they reside as much as we do. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions about any of the properties or the locations, we are always happy to help!",https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/4442348

I started with my own holiday apartment in Edinburgh in 2003. At the time I was working away on an accounting project and decided to let out my home. It was not quite so easy then or trendy but it worked for us. 
When the project was finished I decided to continue being in the holiday business. So I moved back to Edinburgh found a new home in 2005 and continued on the journey in holiday letting.
I enjoy meeting guests and keeping them informed about Edinburgh.  In general, I try to visit the main attractions and places of interest in and around Edinburgh so I am a member of Historic Scotland and The National Trust.
I spend my working and leisure time enjoying what Edinburgh has to offer which is a fantastic array of events, festivals, concerts, fine restaurants, theatre and outdoor space. 
For guests, the highlights are often :-
Edinburgh Castle with it's long and intriguing history but also the world famous Military Tattoo and summer concerts on it's esplanade. 
Holyrood Palace, a royal residence for centuries and still part of the Queens visits to Scotland. There is a new garden layout  being opened to the public this year. 
Arthur Seat is a beautiful park just perfect for relaxing, walking, hiking and viewing the surrounding Lothian countryside including the river Forth.
Along with enjoying the history of buildings and places,  I visit the festivals , theatres, concert and so on.
Edinburgh can keep me busy but I also enjoy travelling and seeing new places.
2020 is a trip to Lisbon, 2019 a trip to Kent both booked through Airbnb
I am happy to help the guests if they have any questions about Edinburgh and some questions on Scotland.

We love Airbnb both as a host and guest and have stayed in some fabulous properties. Being a host myself I understand how important good guests are and always try and be one myself. I also try and make sure our own properties have everything a guest would want.
